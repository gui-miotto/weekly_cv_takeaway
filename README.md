Every week, I read (at least) one paper on the field of computer vision and summarize it
[here](https://gui-miotto.github.io/weekly_cv_takeaway/). Just very brief posts focusing on the findings and takeaway messages.

Most of the time, I pick something that has just been published.
But I also read older studies if the topic interests me.

If you want to contact me, you can find my info on [this page](https://gui-miotto.github.io/).
I welcome reading suggestions, corrections, high fives, etc. :-)
