#### Context

- It is a common practice in the machine learning community to report results from a single run (a single
random seed). This many compromise the statistical validity of the presented results.

#### Takeaways

- The random seed has an important influence on the final accuracy of computer vision models.

- The accuracy difference between a "bad seed" and a "good seed" was found to be around 1% on the
studied benchmarks. But the gap may be even higher if more seeds were evaluated.

- Dependending on the benchmark, improvements greater than 0.5% on the current state-of-art method
are generally considered relevant by the computer vision community.

- It is recommended that studies evaluate many runs with different random seeds. The accuracy should
be published in terms of average, standard deviation, and minimum/maximum values.
