</p>My name is <a href={{site.url}} target="_blank">Guilherme Miotto</a>, and I am a computer vision engineer
based in Germany. It is not easy to keep up with the pace that Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision
progress nowadays. So, inspired by the idea of <a href={{page.atomic}} target="_blank">atomic habits</a>, I decided
to read at least one paper per week in this area and summarize it here. Most of the time, I read something that has
just been published. But I also read older studies if the topic interests me.

</p>If you want to contact me, you can find my info on <a href={{site.url}} target="_blank">this page</a>.
I welcome reading suggestions, corrections, high fives, etc. :-)
